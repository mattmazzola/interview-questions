/**
 * Run-length encoding is a simple compression mechanism that tells
 * how many times a given element should be repeated.  Eg, “AAAAAAAA” could be re-written as “A8”. 
 * 
 * Imagine we have an Iterator pointing to a stream of
 * integers that we want to interpret as RLE instructions, as described below. 
 * 
 * We want to interpret the numbers from this stream as "value", "num_repetition"
 * pairs and implement a new Iterator with next() and hasNext() methods that generate values that respect the RLE instructions.
 * 
 * Assume that Iterator only exposes next() and hasNext().
 * next() should throw an exception when there are no more elements to return. 
 * 
 * Example : given an input iterator pointing to data [8. 3, 1, 1 12, 2], the
 * RLE iterator should return 8 the first 3 times next() is called on it, then
 * 1 a single time, then 12 the next two.  hasNext() should return true until both
 * 12’s have been returned by next(), and then return false.
